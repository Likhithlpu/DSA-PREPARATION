Both dynamically allocated pointers and normal pointers have their own advantages and considerations. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your program. Here's an explanation of the efficiency considerations for both approaches:

Efficiency of Dynamically Allocated Pointers:
Memory Efficiency: Dynamically allocating a 2D array allows you to allocate memory only for the required size, which can save memory compared to a fixed-size array. This is particularly useful when dealing with large or sparse 2D arrays.
Flexibility: Dynamically allocated pointers provide flexibility in terms of resizing the array at runtime based on program needs. This allows for dynamic adaptation to varying data sizes.
Reduced Memory Wastage: Dynamically allocated arrays can help avoid memory wastage when dealing with sparse 2D arrays where many elements are unused. You only allocate memory for the elements that are necessary, reducing overall memory usage.
Performance: Dynamically allocated arrays can be more efficient in terms of memory access and cache utilization compared to fixed-size arrays. Dynamic memory allocation allows for better utilization of available memory and efficient access to non-contiguous memory blocks.
Efficiency of Normal Pointers:
Simplicity: Using a normal pointer to directly point to the 2D array can be simpler and more straightforward, as it requires only one pointer variable to access the entire array.
Reduced Overhead: Normal pointers have less overhead compared to dynamically allocated pointers, as they do not require additional memory for storing pointers to each row.
Now, let's look at the code examples for both approaches:

Dynamically Allocated Pointers:
```cpp
int **array = (int **)malloc(numRows * sizeof(int *));
for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
    array[i] = (int *)malloc(numColumns * sizeof(int));
    // Access elements using indexing
    array[i][j] = value;
}
```

Normal Pointers:

```cpp
int *array = (int *)malloc(numRows * numColumns * sizeof(int));
// Access elements using pointer arithmetic
array[i * numColumns + j] = value;

```

In the dynamically allocated pointers approach, we allocate memory for each row individually and store the pointers in an array of pointers. This provides flexibility and memory efficiency.

In the normal pointers approach, we allocate a contiguous block of memory for the entire 2D array and access elements using pointer arithmetic. This approach is simpler and has less overhead, but it may not be as memory-efficient for large or sparse arrays.

It's important to consider the specific requirements and constraints of your program when choosing between dynamically allocated pointers and normal pointers.
